# Java-Airline-Ticket-Booking-Application
For our second-year group project, we built an airline ticket booking app in Java using NetBeans to create a user-friendly GUI. The app lets users search flights, book tickets, and manage reservations. This project gave us practical experience with GUI design, event-driven programming, and teamwork.
